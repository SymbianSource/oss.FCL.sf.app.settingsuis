* How to use the resource definition:
*
* IMPLEMENTATION_INFO
*    {
*    implementation_uid  = <Your implementation UID here>;
*    version_no          = 1;
*    display_name        = "<Your plugin name here (just for debugging)>";
*    default_data        = "<One of the below UIDs your plugin will be part of>";
*    opaque_data         = "<Position of your plugin in the parent listbox>";
*    }
*
* For example plugins wishing to use Apps Plugin as a parent use 
* KGSAppsPluginUid (defined in GSFWViewUIDs.h):
*
*    default_data = "0x10207239";

// Use this UID if plugin belongs to Main view:
const TUid KGSMainViewUid = { 0x1020723B };


// No item is selected in the container's listbox
const TUid KGSNoneSelected = { 0x00000000 };

// UIDs used by the sub-view plugins:

// Use this UID if plugin belongs to General view:
const TUid KGSGenPluginUid  = { 0x10207237 };

// Use this UID if plugin belongs to Telephony view:
const TUid KGSTelPluginUid  = { 0x1020723D };

// Use this UID if plugin belongs to Connection view:
const TUid KGSConPluginUid  = { 0x10207250 };

// Use this UID if plugin belongs to Applications view:
const TUid KGSAppsPluginUid = { 0x10207239 };

// Use this UID if plugin belongs to Personalisation view:
const TUid KGSPrslnPluginUid = { 0x10207252 };

// Use this UID if plugin belongs to Security view:
const TUid KGSSecurityPluginUid = { 0x1020743A };

// Use this UID if plugin belongs to Standby view:
const TUid KGSStandbyPluginUid = { 0x1020743F };

*
* Note that position of the plugin is supported only for internally provided
* plugins. Others, such as 3rd party plugins, are sorted according to their
* name and plugin provider category.
*
* Plugin position must follow the postition defined in UI specification.
* Position starts from 0. Use -1 if position is not to be used in sorting.
